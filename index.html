                    <p>I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects i learned were current, if not more so, in
                        the company i joined. I honestly feel i got every penny's worth.</p>

                        transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here, I signed up for the
                        free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks
                        was the best-and most grueling-time of my life. Since completing the course, I've successfully
                        switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup."</p>

                    <p>Suck a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</p>
                    <p>"Before joining the bootcamp, i've never written a line of code. I needed some structre from
                        professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a
                        former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire
                        curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and i never had to wait long
                        for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding, It took my learning to
                        the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In face, i've often referred to it
                        during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly helpd me land a job as
                        a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! "</p>
